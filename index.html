            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>There are three ways to style a webpage with css: inline, internal, and external.</li>
              <li>Inline styles apply directly to a specific html tag. It uses a style attribute with a css rule.
                They are useful for quick and permanent changes, but less flexible than external and internal 
                since inline must be edited individually.
              </li>
              <li>Internal style sheet contains css rules in the head section of the html file. It will apply
                to only one page and uses classes and ids.
              </li>
              <li>External is the most common way to styles webpages since it allows developers to keep the css
                rules in an separate file. This method uses a link element in the head section.</li>
                <li>A margin property indicates how much space we want around an object.</li>
                <li>A padding property adds space around the content inside and element. This makes the entire element bigger.</li>
                <li>You can combine two selectors into a single rule with a comma so the declarations affect both selectors.
                  This can look like header, footer then the declaration.
                </li>
                <li>A period before a class name designates it as a class selector. Any element assigned to the class will
                  will gain these css property assignments.
                </li>

            <h2>Git</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>git status: checks what branch you are currently in.</li>
              <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
              <li>git remote -v: should display the URL of your GitHub repository so you can confirm your local repository is connected.</li>
              <li>git pull origin main: synchronizes your local and remote repositories after you make changes.</li>
              <li>git branch: lists all the branches in your local directory.</li>
              <li>git push origin main: pushes or uploads you changes to your remote repository.</li>

            <h2>Javascript</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Variables are containers that store values. You declare a variable with the let or const keyword
                followed by the name you give to the variable.</li>
                <li>You can declare a variable ad give it a value in the same line. You can change the variable value later if you want.</li>
              <li>A semicolon indicates the end of a statement. There are some other rules for semicolons.
              </li>
              <li>Javascript is case sensitive!!!</li>
              <li>A string is a sequence of text. To show that the value is a string you enclose it in quote marks.</li>
              <li>A boolean is a true/false value. Numbers and the special keywords true and false don't need quote marks.</li>
              <li>An array is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference. An array always starts with 0.</li>
              <li>An object can be anything. Everything in javascript is an object and can be stored in a variable.</li>
              <li>Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. If your comment contains no line breaks
                you can put it behind two slashes.
              </li>
              <li>An operator is a math symbol that produces a result based on two values or variables.</li>
              <li>The addition operator can add two numbers or combines two strings. It uses the plus sign.</li>
              <li>The subtraction, multiplication, division operator use the subtraction sign, asterisk, and forward slash respectively.</li>
              <li>An assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. It uses the equal sign.</li>
              <li>The strict equality operator performs a test to see if two values are equal and of the same data type.
                It returns a true/false boolean result and uses three eequal signs over a line.
              </li>
              <li>The Not, Does-not-equal operator returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes.
                it uses the exclamation mark and the exclamation mark followed by two equal signs.
              </li>
              <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not.
                A common use of conditionals is the if...else statement. The expression inside the if is the test and uses the 
                strict equality operator to compare the variable with the string to see if they're equal.
                If the comparison is true the first block of code runs. If the comparison is false then the second block of code runs.
              </li>
              <li>Functions can package functionality that you want to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function
               that executes when you call the function name in your code. This is a good alternative to repeatedly writing the same code.</li>
               <li> Loops aare made of thre components: the keyword for, a three part conditional statement, and a code block.</li>
