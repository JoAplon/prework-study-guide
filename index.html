            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>There are three ways to style a webpage with css: inline, internal, and external.</li>
              <li>Inline styles apply directly to a specific html tag. It uses a style attribute with a css rule.
                They are useful for quick and permanent changes, but less flexible than external and internal 
                since inline must be edited individually.
              </li>
              <li>Internal style sheet contains css rules in the head section of the html file. It will apply
                to only one page and uses classes and ids.
              </li>
              <li>External is the most common way to styles webpages since it allows developers to keep the css
                rules in an separate file. This method uses a link element in the head section.</li>
                <li>A margin property indicates how much space we want around an object.</li>
                <li>A padding property adds space around the content inside and element. This makes the entire element bigger.</li>
                <li>You can combine two selectors into a single rule with a comma so the declarations affect both selectors.
                  This can look like header, footer then the declaration.
                </li>
                <li>A period before a class name designates it as a class selector. Any element assigned to the class will
                  will gain these css property assignments.
